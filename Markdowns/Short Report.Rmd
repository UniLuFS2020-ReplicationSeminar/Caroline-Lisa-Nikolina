# Research Question

Are older companies more likely to be better rated than young enterprises?

# Empirical Hypothesis

Older companies are better established in the market and have more loyal customers. Therefore, older companies are more likely to be better rated than younger firms.

# Test of the empirical hypothesis

First we created a plot visualising the distribution of the ratings across the age of the companies.
We plotted the metric variable "age" on the x-axis and the categorical variable "rating" on the y-axis.

Plotting it we realised that there are a lot of NAs, so we removed them in a seperate script. Then we plotted the data again in another script.
