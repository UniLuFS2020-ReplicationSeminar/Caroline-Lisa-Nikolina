Class Excercise 1 of Caroline, Lisa and Nikolina

Hi there and welcome to our repository! 

We are three students from the University of Lucerne and we are currently working on our first class exercise for the seminar Data Mining for Social and Political Sciences using R. We are excited to learn more about GitHub and how to use it. In this project we will be working on a simple analysis of a dataset about company ratings. In this repository you find the following files:

In the folder "Scripts" you find all the R scripts we used for the analysis. 

In the folder "Visualisations" you find all the visualisations we created for this project. 

And in the folder "Markdowns" you will find our short report of our project with the results of our analysis. 

We hope you enjoy our project and we are looking forward to your feedback!
